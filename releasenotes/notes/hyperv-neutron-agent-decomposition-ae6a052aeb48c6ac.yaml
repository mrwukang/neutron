upgrade:
  - Hyper-V Neutron Agent has been fully decomposed from Neutron. Therefore, the
    `neutron.plugins.hyperv.agent.security_groups_driver.HyperVSecurityGroupsDriver`
    firewall driver has been deprecated and will be removed in the O cycle.
    Update the `neutron_hyperv_agent.conf` files on the Hyper-V nodes to
    use `hyperv.neutron.security_groups_driver.HyperVSecurityGroupsDriver`,
    which is the networking_hyperv security groups driver.
