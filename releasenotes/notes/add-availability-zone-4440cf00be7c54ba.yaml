    Agent scheduling aware of availability zones is now supported.
features:
  - DHCP agent is assigned to an availability zone; network will be hosted by
    the DHCP agent with availability zone which user specifies.
  - L3 agent is assigned to an availability zone; router will be hosted by the
    L3 agent with availability zone which user specifies. This supports the use
    of availability zones with HA routers. DVR isn't supported now because L3HA
    and DVR integration isn't finished.
